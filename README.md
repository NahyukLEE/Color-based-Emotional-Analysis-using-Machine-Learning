## Application
### Example 01 : In Timelaps Video
The graph visualizes how the sensibilities of 'happy', 'press', 'angry' and 'comfort' change over time.

### Example 02 : In 1 minute Movie Scene
The graph shows that the color contrast between green and red shows that the scene effectively reveals emotional changes.

## System Flow
The system flow of our project is as follows. 

### a) K-means Clustering for color
Groups have been formed to ensure that the color spectrum is well representative of the color information of a single image, while maintaining the degree to which the operation speed is not too slow. Thg color spectrum data clustered into five groups were used to analyze images and to use them in the course of future machine learning.

### b) Extracting emotion
Through k-mean clustering, five color information clustered and its ratio determined the RGB color information of the image. The color difference was calculated using Euclidean distance. The harmonization of colors is generally indicated by the coloration relationship, and we calculated and measured the relationship with the adjacent color.

| **Type** | **Date** | **R_avg** | **G_avg** | **B_avg** | **Color_Var** | **V_Var** | **S_Var** | **Label** |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:| :--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| ![](imgs/011.jpg) | ![](imgs/012.jpg) | 41.2 | 6.3 | 4.1 | 8428.3 | 24893.5 | 0.4 | **2 (Passion)** |
| ![](imgs/021.jpg) | ![](imgs/022.jpg) | 9.9 | 9.9 | 9.9 | 2311.1 | 3618.5 | 0.0 | **1 (Depress)** |
| ![](imgs/031.jpg) | ![](imgs/032.jpg) | 41.0 | 33.2 | 34.7 | 10127.2 | 17885.0 | 0.1 | **0 (Happy)** | 
| ![](imgs/041.jpg) | ![](imgs/042.jpg) | 34.7 | 40.0 | 45.2 | 5702.1 | 30707.2 | 0.1 | **3 (Comport)** |

The feature information we used for mechanical learning is as shown in Table. The spectrum was extracted for a given image and the characteristics and labels for each were matched. The labels are numbered 0, 1, 2, 3 and each means happy, depress, passion, and comport.

### c) Machine Learning
Emotional classification models were produced through the representative classification learning algorithms, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. The line was optimized by tuning the hyper parameter of the classification model.

## Code

### Install dependencies
We recommend you to use Anaconda that already including mandotory packages. 
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Our code was tested with Python 3.6.

### Data Preprocessing
Before you extract color spectrum from Video, you should split it by the command below,
```
python split_video.py
```

Then, you can extract color spectrums from frames, and calculate features for your training.
```
python video_analysis.py
```

### Training model & Check Result
To train  classification models with preprocessed dataset, you can handle IPython notebook with 'training.ipynb'.
